Regarding the numerical values, to make the data more suitable for processing by logistic regression models, we scaled the data using sklearn's Standard Scaler. However, the performance of tree-based models were not affected by this change.\n",

    "The goal was to create a machine-learning model that can classify users into the best of the two plan options, so we created 3 classification ML models with varying, manually-tuned hyperparameters and compared their training & validation performance. The performance was measured with the accuracy metric because we needed to know how likely would the model provide the correct predictions. In line with the dataset's imbalance, we set our **baseline accuracy score to 75%** to ensure that the model weren't simply making random correct guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three models, their best hyperparameters, and their respective scores were:\n",
    "1. Decision tree classifier (`max_depth = 3, random_state = 12345`) <br>\n",
