# Oil reserve prediction <br>Supervised Machine Learning Model</br>

## Project description

The ninth project of Practicum's Data Science course. It involves creating (including training, tuning, validating, and testing) several supervised machine-learning models to predict the amount of oil reserves in three regions. Models' predictions were then used to determine the region that had the highest chance of returning profit.
